Libraries and Structures:

The #include statements add the libraries that the program needs. For instance, iostream is used for input/output operations, and time.h is used for time-related operations.
The using namespace std; statement allows you to use elements from the C++ standard library by using the std namespace.
The structure struct Ogrenciler contains student information: name, surname, and grades.
Main Function (main):

It takes necessary information from the user, such as the number of students, weight of assignments, passing grade, weights of exams, etc.
Generating Student Information:

A for loop randomly selects names and surnames for each student, and then assigns grades based on certain rules. These grades include midterm exams, assignments, short quizzes, and final exam grades.
Calculating Letter Grades:

Letter grades are determined based on student grades. There is an array of if-else statements to calculate the number of students in each letter grade.
Class Statistics:

Calculates the end-of-year grade average, standard deviation, highest, and lowest grades in the class.
Calculates the number of students in the class based on letter grades.
Determines percentage rates for each letter grade and prints them to the screen.
Output to the Screen:

Student information, grades, and letter grades are printed to the screen.
Class statistics and class percentage based on letter grades are printed to the screen.

This program generates random student grades, calculates class statistics based on letter grades, and prints them to the screen. Letter grades and percentage rates are used to determine student success in the class. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of how spread out the grades are.
